**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

Executive Summary

A  Jay’s Special Tees was hired by Artemis, Inc. to perform a network penetration test of Artemis' external facing network in order to identify security flaws, determine the impact on Artemis' supply network, document all findings in a clear and repeatable manner, and provide remediation recommendations. The test was carried out using A Jay's Special Tees Security Penetration Testing Method. All testing was carried out by Alicia Jerry Information Security Analyst (ISA) in collaboration with Artemis' Information Technology (IT) staff members to ensure safe, orderly, and complete testing within the approved scope. The assessment was completed in January 2023.

**SCOPE OF WORK**

Scope of Work

This assessment focused on outdated, unsupported, and unpatched hardware, with an emphasis on the external network. Unsuitably configured more recent network infrastructure, improper cloud data storage, website development, and file transfers are a few examples. In addition, we launched some phishing campaigns to see who is adhering to company policy.

The tester also discovered shared folders with excessive permissions, implying that all internal network users have access to a significant amount of data. While file sharing between departments and users is essential for day-to-day business operations, file shares with broad permissions may result in the unintentional disclosure of confidential information.



Even if a file share does not currently contain any sensitive information, someone may unknowingly place such data there, believing it is secure when it is not. This configuration should be changed so that users can only access what they need to perform their daily tasks.

Finally, Artemis should develop a remediation plan based on the report's Remediation Summary section, addressing all high findings as soon as possible based on the needs of the business.

Artemis should also consider conducting periodic vulnerability assessments if they aren't already.

**PROJECT OBJECTIVES**

Project Objectives

With the aim of discovering undiscovered weaknesses, A Jay's Special Tees conducted testing under a "gray box" strategy from January 2, 2023, to January 16, 2023, in order to find as many vulnerabilities and misconfigurations as feasible. Testing was done from a non-evasive stance. Remote testing was carried out using a host that was set up especially for this evaluation.

Each identified weakness was documented and manually investigated to determine exploitation and escalation potential. A Jay's Special Tees attempted to demonstrate the full scope of every vulnerability, including internal domain compromise. If A Jay's Special Tees were successful in gaining access to the internal network, Artemis enabled additional testing such as lateral movement and horizontal/vertical privilege escalation to demonstrate the impact of an internal network compromise.

**ASSUMPTION**

Assumption

Entering into this assessment we had some concerns regarding the use of a (SSO) Single Sign On solution that leverage Microsoft Active Directory to authenticate users to other applications, namely SAP. SAP is the company's primary ERP system, we thought it might have some vulnerabilities. We were also concerned with admins not adhering to company policy and we felt a phishing vulnerability was most definitely a possibility. Also, they are still operating with hardware that is no longer supported or patched.

**TIMELINE**

Timeline

The penetration test began on January 2nd and concluded on January 16 for a total of 15 days of testing.

**SUMMARY OF FINDINGS**

The external phase of the pentest concentrated on publicly accessible assets. Reconnaissance and scanning were performed to identify potential points of intrusion or malicious system modification. Using BurpSuite and the network scanner NMAP, attacks were launched from the A Jay’s network via the Internet to the externally accessible assets at Artemis. We tested IP address 10.0.0.153 from A Jay’s Special Tees.

Actions Taken

The analyst performed internet-level scanning and analysis to determine the risk level of Artemis’ externally accessible hosts and servers.

From Zone: Internet

Via: N/A

To Zone: External Network

Method: Internet penetration testing 

Current Zone Activities: xxx.xxx.39.153

The certificate for the server is not valid for the hostname. A certificate is issued to www.example.com.

However, you can access the https certificate via this IP address. The certificate does not cover the hostname.

HSTS is not mandated. Users are unable to connect to the application via unencrypted connections because the application does not prevent them from doing so. This opens the door to man-in-the-middle attacks on the site by users who click on unencrypted links. Add a response header called "Strict-Transport-Security" with an acceptable max-age expiration time to fix this.

**Nmap Warnings:** 64-bit block cipher 3DES vulnerable to SWEET32 attack 

Broken cipher RC4 is deprecated by RFC 7465

Ciphersuite uses MD5 for message integrity

Key exchange (dh 2048) of lower strength than certificate key

Key exchange (ecdh_x25519) of lower strength than certificate key

Summary of Findings continued..

A Jay's Special Tees discovered five results in total during testing that represent a material risk to the information systems of Artemis, Inc. Risks below are all POSSIBLE.

1. The Cisco hardware is unpatched and unsupported.This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer. 

2. The new network, Fortigate, is not configured properly.A successful exploit could allow the attacker to retrieve sensitive information from the device using the default credential.

3.  File transfers are placing Artemis at risk as well. This flaw allows an attacker to set up a malicious FTP server that can trick FTP clients into connecting back to a given IP address and port. This vulnerability could lead to FTP client scanning ports, which otherwise would not have been possible.

4. We launched a phishing campaign and it was extremely successful. Training on how to maintain confidentiality is imperative to keep intruders away. Just asking nicely will get you a password reset is extremely dangerous. An unauthenticated attacker can generate a link that, if clicked by a logged-in user, can be redirected to a malicious page that could read or modify sensitive information, or expose the user to a phishing attack, with little impact on confidentiality and integrity.

5. The internal SSO that leverages Microsoft Active Directory to authenticate users to SAP may expose company data. Unspecified vulnerability in the SAP CCMS / Database Monitors for Oracle allows attackers to obtain the database password via unknown vectors.

6. This password hash was successfully cracked offline using the Hashcat tool, revealing the user's clear text password and granting access to Artemis’ domain with no more privileges than a regular domain user. The results are summarized by severity degree in the table that follows.

**TECHNICAL FINDINGS DETAILS**

| CRITICAL | HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW |
| --- |  --- |  --- |  --- | 
| 0 | 2 | 3 | 0 |

| Vulnerability ID# | Summary | CVSS Severity |
| --- |  --- |  --- | 
| CVE-2020-35235 | **UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED** vendor/elfinder/php/connector.minimal.php in the

| CVE-2022-20918 | A vulnerability in the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) access controls for Cisco FirePOWER Software for Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) FirePOWER module, Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software, and Cisco Next-Generation Intrusion Prevention System (NGIPS) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to perform an SNMP GET request using a default credential. This vulnerability is due to the presence of a default credential for SNMP version 1 (SNMPv1) and SNMP version 2 (SNMPv2). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending an SNMPv1 or SNMPv2 GET request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to retrieve sensitive information from the device using the default credential. This attack will only be successful if SNMP is configured, and the attacker can only perform SNMP GET requests; write access using SNMP is not allowed.
